# CHURN PREDICTION for UNCUT
> Machine learning and predictive analytics

UNCUT is a website that likes to define itself as the digital artist playground. They can mint the NFTs and commercialize it, while building collections and exchanging experiences with other artists and collectors.
<p>
We used Machine Learning to predict churn for Uncut's clients. We also got a lot of good insights from the Business Analysis.
<p>
We tried a lot of models until we chose Decision Tree, with Grid and Ada Boost to make the predictions

## Dataset

The dataset is not avaliable to download. 
<p>
The original dataset had 16112 rows, and after cleaning endep up with 14474 rows.


## Local App

We've biult a local app to demonstrate the power of our model. It runs both uploading a picture and via live camera on a computer.
On terminal you need to type:

```
streamlit run Uncut_app.py
```

And streamlit will open a tab in your browser, where you can play and test the model. You can play with the paramethers. Try using the Record IDs: 401, 3251 and 707, and then add your own imaginary data to test the predictions.

### Web App

Ypu can also try it online!!

We are working to solve any bugs that might appear. It might not be active right now.
